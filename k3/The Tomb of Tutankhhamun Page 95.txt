SLOWLY DESPERATELY SLOWLY
IT SEEMED TO US AS WE WATCHED
THE REMAINS OF PASSAGE DEBRIS THAT ENCUMBERED
THE LOWER PART OF THE DOORWAY WERE REMOVED
UNTIL AT LAST WE HAD THE WHOLE DOOR CLEAR BEFORE US
THE DECISIVE MOMENT HAD ARRIVED
WITH TREMBLING HANDS I MADE A TINY BREACH
IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER
DARKNESS AND BLANK SPACE AS FAR AS AN IRON TESTINGROD
COULD REACH SHOWED THAT WHATEVER LAY BEYOND WAS EMPTY
AND NOT FILLED LIKE THE PASSAGE WE HAD JUST CLEARED
CANDLE TESTS WERE APPLIED AS A PRECAUTION AGAINST POSSIBLE FOUL GASES
AND THEN WIDENING THE HOLE A LITTLE I INSERTED THE CANDLE AND PEERED IN
LORD CARNARVON LADY EVELYN AND CALLENDER STANDING ANXIOUSLY BESIDE ME
TO HEAR THE VERDICT AT FIRST I COULD SEE NOTHING
THE HOT AIR ESCAPING FROM THE CHAMBER CAUSING THE CANDLE FLAME TO FLICKER BUT PRESENTLY
AS MY EYES GREW ACCUSTOMED TO THE LIGHT
DETAILS OF THE ROOM WITHIN EMERGED SLOWLY FROM THE MIST
STRANGE ANIMALS STATUES AND GOLD  EVERYWHERE THE GLINT OF GOLD
FOR THE MOMENT AN ETERNITY IT MUST HAVE SEEMED TO THE OTHERS STANDING BY
I WAS STRUCK DUMB WITH AMAZEMENT AND WHEN LORD CARNARVON
UNABLE TO STAND THE SUSPENSE ANY LONGER INQUIRED ANXIOUSLY
CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING?
